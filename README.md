# MusicSync
In-game overlay to display the current media playing using the Windows Media API. **NOT MAC/LINUX COMPATIBLE**

Whatever media is most recently started will show in the in-game overlay. This means, if you are watching a Youtube video, and then playing another Youtube video, the new video will take over.

## Compatibilitiy
This is app agnostic, so as long as the application supports the Windows Media API, the overlay will populate. You can see if your media player is supported on Windows 11 by locking your screen and seeing if the media control panel is on:
